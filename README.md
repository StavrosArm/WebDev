# WebDev

## This project aims to showcase skills for HTML , CSS and basic JavaScript.You can preview the project here: https://stavrosarm.github.io/WebDev/

The project follows all the HTML5 standards , and it makes good use of the CSS selectors for reusable stylesheets.It is built based on the classic way of 
creating websites , where each page is fully written from the beginning to the end , and no content is dynamically created. It consists of 8 html files in total :

- index.html
- categories.html
- car-ads.html
- house-rentals
- ContactForm.html
- Peugoet-208-Allure.html
- sign_in.html

All html pages are fully responsive for desktop , tablet and mobile. And also at the sign-in page , JavaScript's CustomValidity API was used for
sign in data validation.

*(Note:Aesthetics is not the target of this project , but to showcase skills on hardcoding HTML , CSS and JS based on best practices provided by 
the Mozzila Developer Network and W3C)*
